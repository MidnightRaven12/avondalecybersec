Here are a few extra remarks:

1. Be careful, as one IP address can point to a bunch of domain names. Say you find the IP address of a server that is hosting the website. You go to it, and you find that there are multple domains on the same website. This will restrict how you attaack, in which you are not going to go and use an `nmap` scan on the entire website. You might even have to go to the other companies and tell them that you are running a penetration test on another person's network, just so that questions aren't raised!

2. There are also a few more interesting things that you can do with [`dnsrecon`](https://www.kali.org/tools/dnsrecon/), and you can check it out with `dnsrecon -h`. In particular, the ones thare going to be the most important are: `-d`, which tells you the domain name that you are going to scan, `-D`, which tells you about other domain names that this scans for, `-t` is the type of scan, and `--threads` is the number of threads.

3. There is one massive tool that isn't even covered, which is [`recon.ng`](https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/) (TO DO.)
