Here are a few extra remarks:

1. Be careful, as one IP address can point to a bunch of domain names. (think with weebly!) Say you find the IP address of a server that is hosting the website. You go to it, and you find that there are multple domains on the same website. This will restrict how you attaack, in which you are not going to go and use an `nmap` scan on the entire website. You might even have to go to the other companies and tell them that you are running a penetration test on another person's network, just so that questions aren't raised!

2. There are also a few more interesting things that you can do with [`dnsrecon`](https://www.kali.org/tools/dnsrecon/), and you can check it out with `dnsrecon -h`. In particular, the ones thare going to be the most important are: `-d`, which tells you the domain name that you are going to scan, `-D`, which tells you about other domain names that this scans for, `-t` is the type of scan, and `--threads` is the number of threads.

3. There is one massive tool that isn't even covered, which is [`recon.ng`](https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/) (TO DO.)

4. There are also a few other free searching tools such as [truth finder](https://www.truthfinder.com/). Additionally, there are also a few different tricks that you can use, such as EXIF files on Google Search Results, and then combining with [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/) for BSSIDs, as well as [SHODAN](https://www.shodan.io), and [CenSys](https://search.censys.io/), in order to enumerate more information.

5. Lastly, there are a few tools that are used. For instance, one of them is [Sherlock](https://www.kali.org/tools/sherlock/), in order to track usernames accross different platforms. Since most people use the same username across different platforms, the problem is that with instagram, you can determine their approximate location, and the first and last name, and so on and so forth.

*Remark: The idea that you can dox someone just from one interaction on a popular game is almost impossible. Although it is theoretically doalbe, the idea that someone can log into the lobby, and then provoke another person, and them looking up some username, and then returning the proper IPv4 address is almost impossible. Even so, if you take some basic security measures such as not clicking suspicious links, not opening up suspicious attachments from people that you don't trust, and set up a random password on your router, you're most likely going to be fine. Just have a Private instagram, and you'll be good! So sorry, Hunter. You're not going to be able to dox that random kid that is somewhere halfway across the school.*
