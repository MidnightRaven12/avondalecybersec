Here are a few extra remarks:

1. Be careful, as one IP address can point to a bunch of domain names. Say you find the IP address of a server that is hosting the website. You go to it, and you find that there are multple domains on the same website. This will restrict how you attaack, in which you are not going to go and use an `nmap` scan.
