(MORE TO ADD AND TO DO!)

The later and later that you get into cybersecurity, it gets to the point in which you figure out which moves to play and why. Cybersecurity is essentially a giant move book with a ton of rules, and things to memorize, with different tradeoffs based on some tools that you have. For instance, a classic `nmap` scan isn't really that high of a risk, (since all you could really do is ban the IP address that "made" the scan), and is really just an annoyance, versus figuring out which techniques that you are replicating, and then having to go back and redo the entire operation. 

Here are four main things to keep track of when it comes to penetration testing (and also threat hunting as well).

1. How hard is it to perform? (Think mana) These can range from different tasks, such as finding the right GitHub repo to run against something (think like 1 mana), or say making an entire botnet, as well as Let's say that an exploit would involve some use of writing a C++ script specifically for some software that was on the system. If you were making a penetration test where you were really, just looking for low hanging fruit and protecting yourself against script kiddies, you probably wouldn't go this route. (in fact, you most likely wouldn't even be able to list the different software that is on the computer in the first place...)
2. How much time
