(MORE TO ADD AND TO DO!)

The later and later that you get into cybersecurity, it gets to the point in which you figure out which moves to play and why. Cybersecurity is essentially a giant move book with a ton of rules, and things to memorize, with different tradeoffs based on some tools that you have. For instance, a classic `nmap` scan isn't really that high of a risk, (since all you could really do is ban the IP address that "made" the scan), and is really just an annoyance. 

*Remark: Yeah: yeah one of our authors had an impatient phase in which a lot of C2 servers they ran basically had ZERO latency. Guy also ran a `-T5` scan every time and would use as many threads as possible. Dude was addicted to speed (not the substance), and wanted to work as fast as possible.*
