These notes are here in order to do the following:

1. Clarify different concepts that are in the book. Many times, there will be foreign concepts that seem contrived (such as literally changing the router rules by changing port forwarding to Port 443 in Lab 8, which seems like cheating.)

2. Try to clarify the overall process and the motivations between why those tools exist. What is far more important is how and why people could be hacked, and why and how people would use X approach instead of Y in order to do something to these machines. This is especially importnat in a lot of [ctfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) (Capture the Flags).

3. Give extensions. Another reason why we wrote this was because there were necessary extensions that should be made and coded up by students. There should be ways in order to strengthen the tools and integrate it into your knowledge base. For instance, creating your own password lists, as well as combining obfuscation techniques in order to create your own viruses, and figuring out [how to create your own web server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-simplehttpserver-http-server) in order to perform [SSRF](https://www.vectra.ai/topics/server-side-request-forgery#:~:text=Server%2DSide%20Request%20Forgery%20(SSRF,strategies%20to%20safeguard%20web%20applications.) ) attacks. See: [Loi Liang Yang's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyt7lUO3mY8)

4. Give some basic skills that everyone who is involved in Cybersecurity (and computer science in general) should know. For instance, knowing how to use [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) and how to use [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). (even though it would be better if everyone knew it.) The problem is that the book never touches on GPG, and only instead focuses on it as a little side quest. Thus, we include some basic things in order to survive in the digital world.

5.  Give many projects in order to expand your knowledge. There are lots of exercises in this book, and it is simply infeasible for anyone to do them all. Therefore, 

*Remark: A lot of Capture the Flags are a lot like escape rooms. (in fact, they are far more similar than it might appear) In particular, there are a few tricks that people will use in order to escape, such as trying to figure out unused information that could be hidden in almost anything (such as the [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) file, or hidden directories which can be found using: [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)), or getting an unusual response from a server. Remember that the more your practice, the more signs that you will see. See [Mark Rober's Tips on Escape Rooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwgaTYOx0RI)*
   
When reading this book, there are several things to take note of.

1. The book itself does not educate you on what many of the flags do. In many instances, there are times where it says some command line input, without even specifying what the different flags even do. Even worse, is that sometimes, **SOME FLAGS** are explained, whereas others are left to the wayside. For example, there is a line in page 88 in a [meterpreter shell](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/manage-meterpreter-and-shell-sessions/), the book wants you to use ``` execute -f powershell.exe -H -I  ``` without explaining what the flags mean, nor explaining some other important metasploit commands, not even giving any way of looking up more. (For reference, the `-f` flag tells you the file to exploit on the computer that it is conencted to, `-H` hides the process from the computer, and `-I` gives you a way to interact with the process. Basically, the command tells the computer to exploit `powershell.exe`, which gives you a far more powerful shell. there are also even ways to send viruses, such as inputting in -a, with `execute -f powershell.exe -H -a "./insert/backdoor/here"`)

Therefore, you would have to **educate yourself** on a bunch of these commands, and what they do, and especially the flags, because the book is simply not going to, despite it being vital. Failure to do so will lead you to becoming nothing but a script kiddie, who is at the whims of people far more talented than you. We have also provided a list of exercises in order to help you on your journey. We emphasize coding as a way of making different programs in order to boost the effectiveness of the tools. Many times, you might be able to find the right tool, but with some coding it allows you to make exploits stronger. For instance: using a Wifi Brute Forcer, as well as a bunch of python in order to create wordlists that are far more likely to be the password. (additionally, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card, you can go and crack passwords much faster due to computational reasons with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone#:~:text=CUDA%C2%AE%20is%20a%20parallel,harnessing%20the%20power%20of%20GPUs.)) 

2.  They only teach you the sort of 'basic' moves. For instance, the use of metasploit is one step in the entire process of hacking into a system. On a bunch of challenges, such as boot2roots, you are going to have to learn when you are going to use metasploit. For instance, if there is an old version that is still be used: hackers can take advantage of that and use metasploit in order to get a shell. Then, one enumeration technique to use is  [`find / -perm 4000 2>&1 > /dev/null`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/497207/difference-between-dev-null-21-and-dev-null-dev-null) in order for pen-testers to find all of the unusual programs that they can run as root. However, the book teaches all of that, and never really connects the dots for you. Thus, we've written these notes in order to make it a little bit easier to connect the dots, and memorize these commands. (also see: [the find command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/) and also the [SUID Sticky bit](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) )

*Remark: Unfortunately, CHAT GPT doesn't even do computer code that well. One time, it gave me: `/c dir` as a valid command in Windows. AI tools are to only be used sparingly, and for relatively simple pieces of code. (but even then...)*

*Exercise 1: Bully AI. There is also a website in which you can try to [bully AI](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/do-not-tell) in order to get what you want. Try to get to as far as you can.*

*Exercise 2: **[IMPORTANT]**Social Engineering + Brute Force attacks. Many people use some piece of their personal lives in order to make passwords. The goal is to have a list of approximately 50 to 100 things that some company (or person, or entity that you are trying to hack) is related to. For instance, it could be a mascot. Write a program that combines a few of these words with common substitutions. Then, on your home computer, make a user account with a password that is a combination of those words. (say [sampleuser:s4ilorm00n](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/)) See [a video on using graphics cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs&t=0s) in order to brute force passwords very quickly, and use Hydra on that machine. This gives you a much better chance of finding a password on either WiFi, or security than with [rockyou.txt](https://weakpass.com/wordlists/rockyou.txt). Bonus points if you can make a sample coffee website and scrape it for any important words and terms. You would most likely need to use the: [`nmcli`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_ip_networking_with_nmcli#sec-Using_the_nmcli_Interactive_Connection_Editor) command. Here is [one possible way](https://github.com/flancast90/wifi-bf/blob/main/src/ssid.py) to write the code in Python. You may also translate it to C++, or any other languages.*

3. The labs are very isolated, and aren't that realistic, and in my opinion are structured horribly. There are many different labs that aren't realistic. EX: Email Phishing. Even with Lab 28 (the different payload labs), there are many antiviruses as well that will filter out this virus. Thus, one must find ways to obfuscate code, or make subtler payloads. For instance: see [malicious Javascript](https://github.com/geeksonsecurity/js-malicious-dataset), as well as, common methods of data obfuscation, such as using `eval()` in order to evaluate functions, instead of actually calling the function name. Or using other encryption methods such as: [affine ciphers](https://math.asu.edu/sites/default/files/affine.pdf), in order to get past SHA256/SHA512/what have you, or what have you file checksum filters.

*Exercise 3: Try to find ways to generate cipher methods for this markdown file all at once, each with different obfuscation methods, as well as generate the SHA256 hash (or any hash that isn't MD5, or god forbid md4). Bonus if you can figure out how to send them to a web server. Extra points for sending it through TOR. Remember to have a way to decrypt your files once your files are on the server. You might want to check your work using [this malware database](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/). This is especially useful for file upload related vulnerabilities. Alternatively, you could also find ways using the social engineer toolkit in order to further ofuscate your code.*

4. Finally, there is almost no possibility to expand on your knowledge, or really any links to help you look for more concepts related to cybersecurity, or computers in general. We personally believe that computers can make beautiful things. Even with ASCII, the excitement of having a computer that lets you express what you feel at any given time cannot be matched. As of this year, there is no lab dedicated to simply having fun with computers.

Examples: using msg * "deez nuts" in Windows in order to message every computer on the network "deez nuts", or using ascii as well as changing the registry in windows (or linux) for a custom command terminal. Or just having Bad Apple run on schoology. You should be encouraged to play and experiment with computers, especially with javascript, and all of the tools of the trade avaliable to you. 

*Exercise 4: From the command line, try to find a way in order to use [`schtasks`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/schtasks) in order to message a message at a specific time. Try to use `schtasks` or `crontab` in order to create a way of maintaining access into a system (say via using `netcat`). Bonus points if you are able to make many tasks at the same time to prevent deletion via a simple [regex](https://regexr.com/).*

With that in mind, we dive into a few pen testing notes for different chapters.
