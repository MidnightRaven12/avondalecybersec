When reading this book, there are several things to take note of.

1. The book itself does not educate you on what many of the flags do. In many instances, there are times where it says some command line input, without even specifying what the different flags even do. Even worse, is that sometimes, **SOME FLAGS** are explained, whereas others are left to the wayside. For example, there is a line in page 88 in a Meterpreter shell of ``` execute -f powershell.exe -H -I  ``` without explaining what the flags mean, nor explaining some other important metasploit commands, not even giving any way of looking up more. (For reference, the `-f` flag tells you the file to exploit on the computer that it is conencted to, `-H` hides the process, and `-I` gives you a way to interact with the process. Basically, the command tells the computer to exploit `powershell.exe`, which gives you a far more powerful shell. there are also even ways to send viruses, such as inputting in -a, with `execute -f powershell.exe -H -a "./insert/backdoor/here"`)

Therefore, you would have to **educate yourself** on a bunch of these commands, and what they do, and especially the flags, because the book is simply not going to, despite it being vital. Failure to do so will lead you to becoming nothing but a script kiddie, who is at the whims of people far more talented than you. 

2.  They only teach you the sort of 'basic' moves. For instance, the use of metasploit is one step in the entire process of hacking into a system. On a bunch of challenges, such as boot2roots, you are going to have to learn when you are going to use metasploit. For instance, if there is an old version that is still be used: hackers can take advantage of that and use metasploit in order to get a shell. Then, one enumeration techniques to use is  [`find / -perm 4000 2>&1 > /dev/null`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/497207/difference-between-dev-null-21-and-dev-null-dev-null) in order for pen-testers to find all of the unusual programs that they can run as root. However, the book teaches all of that, and never really connects the dots for you. Thus, we've written these notes in order to make it a little bit easier to connect the dots, and memorize these commands. (also see: [the find command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/) and also the [SUID Sticky bit](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) )
