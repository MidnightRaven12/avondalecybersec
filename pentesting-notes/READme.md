When reading this book, there are several things to take note of.

1. The book itself does not educate you on what many of the flags do. In many instances, there are times where it says some command line input, without even specifying what the different flags even do. Even worse, is that sometimes, **SOME FLAGS** are explained, whereas others are left to the wayside. For example, there is a line in page 88, with its use of ``` execute -f powershell.exe -H -I  ```
