When reading this book, there are several things to take note of.

1. The book itself does not educate you on what many of the flags do. In many instances, there are times where it says some command line input, without even specifying what the different flags even do. Even worse, is that sometimes, **SOME FLAGS** are explained, whereas others are left to the wayside. For example, there is a line in page 88 in a Meterpreter shell of ``` execute -f powershell.exe -H -I  ``` without explaining what the flags mean, nor explaining some other important metasploit commands, not even giving any way of looking up more. (For reference, the `-f` flag tells you the file to exploit on the computer that it is conencted to, `-H` hides the process, and `-I` gives you a way to interact with the process. Basically, the command tells the computer to exploit `powershell.exe`, which gives you a far more powerful shell. there are also even ways to send viruses, such as inputting in -a, with `execute -f powershell.exe -H -a "./insert/backdoor/here"`)

Therefore, you would have to **educate yourself** on a bunch of these commands, and what they do, and especially the flags, because the book is simply not going to, despite it being vital. Failure to do so will lead you to becoming nothing but a script kiddie, who is at the whims of people far more talented than you. 

2.  They only teach you the sort of 'basic' moves. For instance, the use of metasploit is one step in the entire process of hacking into a system. On a bunch of challenges, such as boot2roots, you are going to have to learn when you are going to use metasploit. For instance, if there is an old version that is still be used: hackers can take advantage of that and use metasploit in order to get a shell. Then, one enumeration technique to use is  [`find / -perm 4000 2>&1 > /dev/null`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/497207/difference-between-dev-null-21-and-dev-null-dev-null) in order for pen-testers to find all of the unusual programs that they can run as root. However, the book teaches all of that, and never really connects the dots for you. Thus, we've written these notes in order to make it a little bit easier to connect the dots, and memorize these commands. (also see: [the find command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/) and also the [SUID Sticky bit](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/suid-sgid-sticky-bit) )

*Remark: Unfortunately, CHAT GPT doesn't even do computer code that well. One time, it gave me: `/c dir` as a valid command in Windows. AI tools are to only be used sparingly, and for relatively simple pieces of code. (but even then...)*

**Exercise 1: Social Engineering + Brute Force attacks. Many people use some piece of their personal lives in order to make passwords. The goal is to have a list of approximately 50 to 100 things that some company (or person, or entity that you are trying to hack) is related to. For instance, it could be a mascot. Write a program that combines a few of these words with common substitutions. Then, on your home computer, make a user account with a password that is a combination of those words. (say [sampleuser:s4ilorm00n](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/), for anime fans) See [a video on using graphics cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs&t=0s) in order to brute force passwords very quickly, and use Hydra on that machine. This gives you a much better chance of finding a password on either WiFi, or security than with [rockyou.txt](https://weakpass.com/wordlists/rockyou.txt). Bonus points if you can make a sample coffee website and scrape it for any important words and terms. You would most likely need to use the: [`nmcli`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/networking_guide/sec-configuring_ip_networking_with_nmcli#sec-Using_the_nmcli_Interactive_Connection_Editor) command. Here is [one possible way](https://github.com/flancast90/wifi-bf/blob/main/src/ssid.py) to write the code in Python. You may also translate it to C++, or any other languages.**

3. The labs are very isolated, and aren't that realistic, and in my opinion are structured horribly. There are many different labs that aren't realistic. EX: Email Phishing. Even with Lab 28 (the different payload labs), there are many antiviruses as well that will filter out this virus. Thus, one must find ways to obfuscate code, or make subtler payloads. For instance: see [malicious Javascript](https://github.com/geeksonsecurity/js-malicious-dataset), as well as, common methods of data obfuscation, such as using `eval()` in order to evaluate functions, instead of actually calling the function name. Or using other encryption methods such as: [affine ciphers](https://math.asu.edu/sites/default/files/affine.pdf), in order to get past SHA256/SHA512, or what have you file checksum filters.

*Exercise 2: Try to find ways to generate cipher methods for this markdown file all at once, each with different obfuscation methods, as well as generate the SHA256 hash (or any hash that isn't MD5, or god forbid md4). Bonus if you can figure out how to send them to a web server. Extra points for sending it through TOR. Remember to have a way to decrypt your files once your files are on the server.*

4. Finally, there is almost no possibility to expand on your knowledge, or really any links to help you look for more concepts related to cybersecurity, or computers in general. We personally believe that computers can make beautiful things. Even with ASCII, the excitement of having a computer that lets you express what you feel at any given time cannot be matched. As of this year, there is no lab dedicated to simply having fun with computers.

Examples: using msg * "deez nuts" in order to message every computer on the network "deez nuts", or using ascii as well as changing the registry in winodws (or linux) for a custom command terminal. Or just having Bad Apple run on schoology. You should be encouraged to play and experiment with computers, especially with javascript, and all of the tools of the trade avaliable to you. 

With that in mind, we dive into a few pen testing notes.
