Yes, this does indeed work. Unfortunately, many people are trained to know that the people that 'break in' are people that are trying to either rob the place of business. But, you know what? I'm Michael, from Microsoft, and I'm here in order to check your network. I'm David from IT, and I'm here in order to check on whether or not you used some unauthorized access software. And a lot of people, will just let you right in, without even contesting you! See: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Vf3NjTPsI) for more ways on how to get into businesses. There is also another social engineering tool as well.

[URL Shortener using Grabify](https://grabify.link/) People tend to click on links without them knowing. Hence, that will make them reveal their IP address. This can be bypassed by using a VPN.

Additionally: here are also a few things that are not covered in this book.

1. Gain the trust of another individual. This can be done through multiple different ways, including pretending to be an IT professional, or someone that works at Microsoft.

2. Or bully them into giving you their computer.

3. Ask them to share more about themselves, and the lives that they led. More times than not, this will give you more trust, when you are breaking into a company.

Here is one good example of this from [Mr. Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWzQgJ-jskI). (yeah, yeah, Mr. Robot isn't that good, but these are a few of the examples that I found in the wild.)




*Remark: It absolutely depends on what context the IP addressed is revealed in. For instance, if it were to be a home network that you were penetrating, an IP address is critical in order to launch further attacks, whereas say when hacking a web application, it doesn't matter all that much. The idea that revealing an IP address is a final blow in all situations is misguided. However, it is a final blow, if you are being tracked by law enforcement. (more generally, it isn't about the information itself. It's about what you could do what that information.)*
