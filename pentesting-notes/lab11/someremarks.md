Yes, this does indeed work. Unfortunately, many people are trained to know that the people that 'break in' are people that are trying to either rob the place of business. But, you know what? I'm Michael, from Microsoft, and I'm here in order to check your network. I'm David from IT, and I'm here in order to check on whether or not you used some unauthorized access software. And a lot of people, will just let you right in, without even contesting you! See: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Vf3NjTPsI) for more ways on how to get into businesses. There is also another social engineering tool as well.

[URL Shortener using Grabify](https://grabify.link/) People tend to click on links without them knowing. Hence, that will make them reveal their IP address. This can be bypassed by using a VPN.

Additionally: here are also a few things that are not covered in this book.

1. Gain the trust of another individual. This can be done through multiple different ways, including pretending to be an IT professional, or someone that works at Microsoft.

2. Or bully them into giving you their computer.

3. Ask them to share more about themselves, and the lives that they led. More times than not, this will give you more trust, when you are breaking into a company.

Here is one good example of this from [Mr. Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWzQgJ-jskI). (yeah, yeah, Mr. Robot isn't that good, but these are a few of the examples that I found in the wild.)

Additionally, there are many tools that you could use when trying to go on a social engineering engagement. There are: rubber duckys (found in the next chapter), as well as [cameras in pens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGRJCL7G?psc=1&language=en_US). Social engineering is so powerful, that even in many cases, you could even do it in here. Even just by walking confidently, and not trying to hide behind a wall whenever you see a teacher is infinitely more powerful, because they were not trained to recognize students that were being confident.  

Social engineering is the fundamental reason why malware hides in files that seem 'too good to be true', like pirated games, and movies (though these can be counteracted by using [bit torrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/)), and also pirated books, and most notably, adult videos and pictures. In fact:

> Almost 90% of attacks are carried out through social engineering. Even if you've got the best security system in the world, and the best encryption scheme that would fry even the best quantum computers of the future, it takes Cathy the secretary to plug in the USB drive that she found, and now, the entire network is compromised. Thanks, Cathy. 

*Remark: Yeah, unfortunately, there are people that store several gigabytes (one author saw over 600 GB) of adult videos, when trying to fix a kid's computer. It is far more common than what most people would think.*

**Note that these are going to be joke exercises in order to illustrate the different use cases of hacking. But you get the point. There are several different ways to make the attack go through.**

*Exercise 1: A love letter. Say we leave a love letter in the car/mailbox to our target. How likely do you think that they will pick up the USB drive and see what is on it?*

*Exercise 2: A love letter in the office. Say there is a love letter on somebody's desk. How likely is it that they're going to open it in the 'secure area' that they are in?*

*Remark: It absolutely depends on what context the IP addressed is revealed in. For instance, if it were to be a home network that you were penetrating, an IP address is critical in order to launch further attacks, whereas say when hacking a web application, it doesn't matter all that much. The idea that revealing an IP address is a final blow in all situations is misguided. However, it is a final blow, if you are being tracked by law enforcement. (more generally, it isn't about the information itself. It's about what you could do what that information.)*
