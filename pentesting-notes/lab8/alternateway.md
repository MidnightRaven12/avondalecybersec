The main chain of attack is the following.

1. Intercept the packet to the server.
2. Figure out where people could input their passwords.
3. Use either a python program or some other brute force thing that could quickly implement passwords, as well.
4. Then, go and get the router password and log in.
5. Configure the Port Forwarding to the Admin PC (10.0.2.51:22 -> 10.0.5.2:22), or just really anything. (also, just say anything that is not SSH attack)
