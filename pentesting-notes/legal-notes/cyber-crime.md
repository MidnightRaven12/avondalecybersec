Ah yes, cybercrime. A word that strikes fear into the hearts of many in the media, and ends many news reporters into a frenzy. How do children, some of who probably can't even shave yet, hack some large govenrment organization and bring its to its knees? How does a bunch of ragtag Anonymous people on a random forum come together and coordinate DDOS attacks and bring awarness to many of the world's leading issues, while simultaneously sending memes to each other. Cybercrime is given a level of mystery and is romanticized in so many different films. It's a way of getting people's attetion quickly, and is one of the main avenues to directly brag about what you have done in the cyber world. In many cases, it is orders of magnitude more profitable to engage in it. From selling scripts to the highest bidder (or for script kids), to engaging in international crimes stealing millions of dollars. 

The way that many cybercriminals engage in cybercrime is by the same way that is done in the streets. Have young kids that were alone and desperate for money or attention, then identify them, and then groom them.  (yes Diddy.) Many older cybercriminals look for kids in hacker forums, but they look for them in games, and then talk about how they are part of some group. They look for kids that feel vulnerable and look for kids that know a little bit about cybersecurity, and show some interest in it. They make them feel important, by showing them the things that cybercriminals can do. The power that you could get from just hacking a few government organizations. The family of hackers that believe and think the same way you do. You know, people will always try to find people who they can call family. And money too. The millions and millions of dollars siphoned...a small sum of a hundred grand of that could be yours to keep and spend however you like. How would you like all of that after clicking a few buttons and running a few scripts? How would you like us to teach you how to engage in cybercrime, and immerse you in a secret world where you will fit just right in, even if not perfectly? It could be all yours, kid. 

As penetration testers, you must be intimiately aware of what cybercrime is and the methods that people will use to try to commit it. You must know about adversary emulation, as well as what types of capabilities said adversary will have, and what some APT (or script kid) will focus on and then try to exploit. These people usually end up
