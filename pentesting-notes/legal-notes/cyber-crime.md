Ah yes, cybercrime. A word that strikes fear into the hearts of many in the media, and ends many news reporters into a frenzy. How do children, some of who probably can't even shave yet, hack some large govenrment organization and bring its to its knees? How does a bunch of ragtag Anonymous people on a random forum come together and coordinate DDOS attacks and bring awarness to many of the world's leading issues, while simultaneously sending memes to each other. Cybercrime is given a level of mystery and is romanticized in so many different films. It's a way of getting people's attetion quickly, and is really one of the only avenues to directly brag about what you have done in the cyber world. In many cases, it is orders of magnitude more profitable to sell your scripts to the highest bidder, for script kiddies to use it against their schools, and make some primitive phishing attacks (many of which are one subpeona away from being arrested).
