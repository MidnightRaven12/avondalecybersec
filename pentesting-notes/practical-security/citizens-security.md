It is a fundamental right that we should have privacy. Therefore, we will give a few resources in order to show some ways that you could creatively implement security everywhere.

1. [ssd.eff.org](https://ssd.eff.org/) These are many security tips for almost everyone, and is an essential tool if you're planning to go to protests, as well as different aspects on how to protect yourself. It's a pretty good thing to read up on.

Instead, the legal profession could span over different fields such as the art field (think copyrights, and defamation lawsuits, and Drake). As well as those that are relating to say health (say fighting against health insurance in order to get their payments, as well as helping people interpret their health insurance policies) And you having a niche might make you stand out.*
